I am a beginner 3D artist with a passion for creating detailed and imaginative digital sculptures. My journey in the world of 3D art has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and explore new techniques. Recently, I have started to delve into programming to enhance my 3D sculpting capabilities and bring my creations to life through interactive applications. My goal is to merge my artistic talents with technical expertise to create immersive and innovative digital experiences.

## Skills 
I have experience with a variety of programming languages and design tools that help me bring my creative visions to life. Below are some of the key skills I have developed:

- **Programming Languages**: I am proficient in Python and C, which I use to create scripts and applications that enhance my 3D art projects. I am also currently learning C++ and C# to expand my programming capabilities and explore game development.

- **Design Tools**: I use Adobe Photoshop and After Effects for creating and editing digital images and animations. Adobe Lightroom helps me with photo editing, and Canva is my go-to tool for designing graphics and presentations.

- **UI/UX Design**: I have a foundational understanding of HTML5, which I use to create and design user interfaces for web applications. I am continuously learning and improving my skills in this area to create more user-friendly and visually appealing designs.
